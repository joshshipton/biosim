### Brain

Brain is actually noting but

f(sight, smell, hearing, taste, touch) = (speech, movement)

Our birds only have one sensory input their brains can be then approximated as f(sight) = movement

can represent this functions input, as a list of numbers with each number descring how close the nearest food object is.

output will be like (delta speed, delta rotation)

an output of (0.1, 45) mean that the brain is saying " body increase speed by 0.1 units and rotate us 45 degrees clockwise, while (0,0,0) will mean "body, please keep our course steady".


### An introduction to Neural Nets

Brains are made of neurons connected via synapases.



### backpropagation

a way to teach algorithms for FFNNS

you show your network lots of eamples of the form of "for this input you should return that" and backpropagation slowly adjusts your network's weights until it gets the answers right.
